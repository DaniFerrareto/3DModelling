# 3DModelling
Here I present my complete collection of OpenSCAD routines for modelling 3D objetcs, for 3D Printing and Machining. I recommend you to look those other repositories as well:

This is the repository of an undergraduate scientific initiation project funded by FAPESP entitled "Geração, Controle e Caracterização de Campos magnéticos gerados por bobinas de Helmholtz 3D" (Generation, Control and Characterization of Magnetic Fields Generated by 3D Helmholtz Coils) which contains all the data and information obtained during the project.

Here are some functions/modules put together in a single .scad file to use it as library for other bigger projects:
